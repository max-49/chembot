'''
This is the Spaces class, the callback class that is required for any discord.py view, in this case, for buttons. 
This class is called whenever a new word is inputted or the game is quit.
When a new word is inputted, it compares the word to the real word and decides whether the button should be gray, green, or purple, following standard Wordle rules.
When an exit (exitt in __init__) parameter is sent (sent when a user manually quits or runs out of guesses), all buttons are deactivated and the game ends.

    When a user runs the wordle command, a word is selected from the "words" list and a game is initialized.
    From there, the user has 5 tries to guess the word. When a word is inputted, it is checked to make sure it is 5 letters long 
    and is in the wordlist and if it satisfies those conditions, it is deleted and sent to the Spaces() class for determining colors.
    If the user guesses the word, the value of the Spaces "view" will be set to False, and the command will prompt a win scene.
    If the user quits early, no scene changes are done and the buttons just deactivate.
    If the user fails to guess the word in 5 tries, the buttons deactivate and a lose scene is prompted.
